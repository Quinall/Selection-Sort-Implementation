# Selection Sort Implementation in C++

This repository contains a C++ program implementing the selection sort algorithm. The selection sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the order) element from the unsorted part of the array and moves it to the sorted part. 

## Program Description

The program generates random integer arrays of different sizes and sorts them using the selection sort algorithm. It then calculates the number of comparisons made during the sorting process and compares it with the expected number of comparisons for each array size.

### Functions:

1. `RandomArray`: Generates a random integer array of specified size.
2. `Print`: Prints the elements of the array.
3. `SelectSort`: Implements the selection sort algorithm to sort the array and counts the number of comparisons made.
4. `Przewid`: Calculates the expected number of comparisons for a given array size.

## How to Use:

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will generate random arrays, sort them using selection sort, print the sorted arrays, and display the number of comparisons made during the sorting process along with the expected number of comparisons for each array size.
